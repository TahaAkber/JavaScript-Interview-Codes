## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TahaAkber/JavaScript-Interview-Codes.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd javascript-interview-codes
   ```

3. Open the code files in your favorite editor (e.g., VSCode).

## Topics Covered

This repository includes code snippets and explanations on:

### Basic Concepts
- Variables and Data Types
- Functions and Closures
- Loops and Conditional Statements

### Intermediate Concepts
- Prototypes and Inheritance
- Asynchronous Programming (Promises, Async/Await)
- Event Loop and Callbacks

### Advanced Concepts
- Design Patterns
- Functional Programming
- Memory Management and Optimization

### Problem-Solving Examples
- Array and String Manipulation
- Sorting Algorithms
- Recursion Examples
- DOM Manipulation Examples

## Sample Code
Here is a simple example demonstrating closure in JavaScript:

```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
  return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
    console.log(`Outer Variable: ${outerVariable}`);
    console.log(`Inner Variable: ${innerVariable}`);
  };
}

const newFunction = outerFunction('outside');
newFunction('inside');
```

### Explanation
This code demonstrates how closures allow inner functions to access variables defined in their outer function even after the outer function has executed.

## Running the Code
